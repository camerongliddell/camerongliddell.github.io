                        After having
                        not visited HTML or CSS in a long time, I felt as if it was a great challenge to refresh my
                        skills in this area. After getting a good design from Jess, and some colour and style ideas from
                        an illustrator friend of mine, I took this challenge head-on! Making this website sparked my old
                        interest in making websites right back up!<br><br>Jessicamedway.com: <a href="jessicamedway.com"

                        when NFTs were a trending thing! We were going to create our own NFT, and I wasted tasked with
                        creating the website. I used multiple libraries to make sure that the website was appealing to
                        anyone coming, as well as making a working minting button with links to Opensea where the NFTs
                        could be purchased. However, the project fell through when people got too busy, and thus I was
                        just left with a very good portfolio piece. The idea behind the boxes at the bottom was that the
                        images would change every couple of seconds, being a gallery-style way to show off all of the
                        NFTs. They also had an awesome 3D effect (Which I've also added here)!<br><br>Repository: <a
